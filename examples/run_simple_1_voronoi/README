This is the same as the run_simple_1/ model, but now built on an unstructured
grid. In this version a Voronoi grid is set up. A set of randomly placed points
is created. From this, a Voronoi tesselation is generated. The centers of the
Voronoi cells are the random points we created initially.

The Voronoi grid is written to a file, and so is the density. The rest works
the same as for run_simple_1/
