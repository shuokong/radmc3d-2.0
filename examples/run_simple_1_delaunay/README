This is the same as the run_simple_1/ model, but now built on an unstructured
grid. In this version a Delaunay grid is set up. A set of randomly placed points
is created. From this, a Delaunay triangulation is generated, which creates
tetrahedral (simplex) cells spanned by neighboring points. The centers of these
cells are then used as the sampling points where the density of the Gaussian
cloud is computed.

The Delaunay grid is written to a file, and so is the density. The rest works
the same as for run_simple_1/
