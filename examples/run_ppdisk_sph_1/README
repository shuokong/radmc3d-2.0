This model setup demonstrates how to map a 3D SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) model
of a protoplanetary disk or circumstellar envelope onto a spherical grid for doing
RADMC-3D calculations. The mapping is done using python/radmc3d_tools/sph_to_sphergrid.py
which is an efficient but very simple SPH-to-grid mapping code. It can only map onto a
spherical grid with equal spacing in log(r), theta and phi. For circumstellar envelopes
and disks this is usually sufficient, but it may be necessary to add more grid refinement
near the inner edge _after_ the mapping to avoid optical depth issues near the inner edge
(see example run_ppdisk_analytic_2). This can only be done after the mapping, because the
mapping code uses an FFT convolution method with a global kernel, which strictly enforces
equal spacing in log(r), theta and phi.

This example does not read in any real SPH model. A "dummy SPH model" is generated
internally, just as a demo. But given that an SPH dataset is merely a list of positions
of particles and their masses, it should be easy to replace the dummy model with a
real SPH dataset of any SPH code (or other code types such as Arepo). However, this
setup is not suited for arbitrary model geometries such as 3-D SPH simulations of
Giant Molecular Clouds, because they are not well mapped onto a regular spherical grid.

The python script that does the conversion from a list of SPH particles to a RADMC-3D
model is:

   problem_setup.py

To run this model:

   python problem_setup.py
   radmc3d mctherm
   ipython --matplotlib
   %run plot_images.py

To view the structure, you can play with plot_structure.py and plot_structure_widget.py

IMPORTANT NOTE OF CAUTION:

   Note that the structures you see in the lambda = 1 micron image are purely
   the result of the low number statistics of the "SPH particles" (here just a
   dummy model). This issue will be more serious the more optically thick the
   disk is, and/or the fewer SPH particles you have. In fact, for very optically
   thick disks it may be impossible to properly sample the surface layers where
   the scattering happens, because of the minimum mass of the SPH
   particles. Consider this: If your disk model is, on average, vertically
   resolved by "only" 100 SPH particles of equal mass, and if the disk has a
   scattering optical depth of 1e5, then the scattering tau=1 surface would be
   in the upper 1e-5 of the column depth, which is completely unresolved by the
   100 SPH particles (each of which contributes an optical depth of
   1e5/100=1e3). This is why SPH models may have problems handling short
   wavelength (i.e. high-kappa) radiative transfer, unless the SPH model somehow
   splits SPH particles into smaller-mass ones to resolve the upper layers.
   This is a problem that also appears for other RT methods, for instance those
   that use Voronoi grids. It is a fundamental limitation of SPH models, unless
   they use sophisticated particle-splitting schemes so that they can
   dynamically resolve the flimsy surface layers of the disk. The physical
   origin of this problem is that one needs only an exceedingly small amount of
   fine-grained dust to create high optical depths: From the opacity file you
   can see that dust can have an opacity at optical wavelengths easily of order
   3x10^4. That means that a disk with a surface density Sigma_gas = 10^3 (for
   e.g. the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 au) you would have Sigma_dust =~ 10
   (rough estimate, assuming dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01), which leads to a
   vertical optical depth of 10*3x10^4 = 3x10^5.  The fraction of the surface
   density above the upper tau=1 layer is then the inverse of that, i.e. roughly
   3x10^{-6}. That is 5 pressure scale heights above the midplane!
   (exp(-5^2/2)=3.7266e-6). Even for grid-based hydrodynamics codes it is
   already challenging enough to model up to 5 scale heights without the code
   crashing. For SPH this challenge will be even higher. Fortunately the
   problem is less severe for larger radii (~100 au) and for lower disk
   masses and/or strong dust depletion. But one has to take care of this
   potential SPH resolution issue for scattered light and/or infrared thermal
   emission. For ALMA wavelengths this is much less an issue (or no issue
   at all) given that the optical depths at those wavelengths are much less
   high.
