What is RADMC-3D?
=================

RADMC-3D is a software package for astrophysical radiative transfer calculations
in arbitrary 1-D, 2-D or 3-D geometries. It is mainly written for continuum
radiative transfer in dusty media, but also includes modules for gas line
transfer. Typical applications would be protoplanetary disks, pre- and
proto-stellar molecular cloud cores, and similar objects. It does not treat
photoionization of gas, nor does it treat chemistry. It can self-consistently
compute dust temperatures for the radiative transfer, but it is not equipped for
self-consistent gas temperature computations (as this requires detailed coupling
to photochemistry). The main strength of RADMC-3D lies in the flexibility of the
spatial setup of the models: One can create or use parameterized dust and/or gas
density distributions, or one can import these from snapshots of hydrodynamic
simulations.
